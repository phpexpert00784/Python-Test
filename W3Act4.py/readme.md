# School Database System Using Python OOP and SQLite3

This project demonstrates a simple school information system built using
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python and SQLite3 as the database engine.
The system stores students, teachers, courses, enrollments, and teaching
assignments using a well-designed relational database.

The program automatically creates the database, inserts sample records, and then
performs two required queries:
1. Display the number of students enrolled in the course **MSE800**.
2. Display the list of teachers who are teaching the course **MSE801**.

The repository includes:
- `project.py` — main Python OOP source code with inline comments  
- `school.db` — SQLite database (auto-generated by the script)  
- `ER_Diagram.png` — database design screenshot  
- `README.md` — this scenario description
